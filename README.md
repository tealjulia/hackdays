## How to Install
(must have `npm` installed locally... though when we share this out, we can upload the `build` output to avoid that step!

Run `npm run build` in the main directory
Go to chrome://extensions from the Chrome address bar
In the upper right, make sure the "Developer Mode" toggle is on
Click "Load Unpacked"
Select ./build directory from this project to load the extension
